# Contribution Guidelines

Primary conventions source: `AGENTS.md`

- Keep changes focused and use conventional commit prefixes (`fix:`, `feat(ui):`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`).
- Run quality gates (Black, Ruff, Mypy, Pytest) before PR.
- Include PR summary, affected paths, test evidence, linked issue/story, and UI screenshots when relevant.
- Never commit `.env` files or secrets.
- Use `config.yaml.example` for safe config templates.
