# User Provided Context

YOLO-mode inferred context from current collaboration:

- Prioritize desktop web UX for all four critical tasks: choosing configs, preparing inputs, launching runs, and interpreting results.
- Ensure intuitive UX with concise what/why/how guidance on every key decision surface.
- Preserve strong defaults and download/install-ready behavior.
- Add explicit visual confirmation of selections and verify-before-run confirmations.
- Surface integrity and failure states explicitly; avoid silent errors and hidden data-integrity issues.
- Focus domain framing on governance, risk controls, cybersecurity, and financial services workflows.
