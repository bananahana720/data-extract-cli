# Optional Real-World Corpus

This directory is intentionally empty in the public repository.

Reason:
- Public fixture set must avoid redistributing third-party framework documents.

If you want to run local benchmarks with real-world material:
1. Place legally redistributable PDF/XLSX files in this directory.
2. Keep filenames stable if you rely on historical benchmark baselines.
3. Do not commit proprietary or licensed documents to the repository.
