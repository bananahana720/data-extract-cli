Background The document extraction tool processes various file formats including DOCX, PDF, PPTX, and XLSX files. This simple text file serves as a basic fixture for testing core extraction logic. Testing Approach When testing extractors, we follow these patterns: 1. Test successful extraction with valid files 2. Test error handling with invalid files 3. Test format-specific features 4. Test edge cases like empty or very large files Expected Results This file should be extracted as: - A heading block for each section title - Paragraph blocks for each text section - Proper sequence ordering maintained Conclusion This fixture file provides a baseline for testing text extraction capabilities of the system.",
