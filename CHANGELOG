- Refactored GUI New Run and Job Detail lifecycle UX with explicit source-mode selection, inline validation, action-first layout, and lifecycle timeline.
- Added stable UI test hooks and expanded lifecycle e2e assertions for source-mode clarity, validation, next-action guidance, and timeline presence.
- Introduced tokenized and reusable UI style primitives with focus-visible accessibility and responsive hardening while preserving existing shared panel/status/table patterns.
- Updated user/runtime/quickstart docs to describe the new UX behavior and runtime hygiene expectations.
- Added `.ui-home/` git ignore coverage and untracked `.ui-home/app.db` from the repository index.
- Updated installation validation runtime home defaults to avoid repo-tracked UI runtime state when `DATA_EXTRACT_UI_HOME` is unset.
- Verified Python-side gates and contract tests still pass; UI gate remains environment-blocked due unavailable npm registry and Playwright assets in this workspace.
- Serialized retry lifecycle persistence so queued state/event commit before retry worker enqueue, eliminating retry-path write races in SQLite.
- Removed temporary lifecycle e2e retry mitigations (`ui` test loop + Playwright CLI retries) and added router regression coverage to the refactor tests gate.

- Hardened local UI/API runtime resilience: startup recovery for queued/running jobs, SQLite WAL/busy-timeout tuning, configurable in-process worker concurrency, and richer health/readiness telemetry.
- Added security and deployment safeguards: API-key middleware support, remote host guardrails in `data-extract ui`, and centralized runtime dependency/readiness checks (including spaCy model validation).
- Reduced API/UI lock pressure with jobs/detail pagination plus client-side database-lock retries and adaptive polling behavior.
- Expanded API/runtime test coverage for auth middleware, health payload detail, queue worker behavior, startup job recovery, and jobs pagination.
- Applied repository-wide lint/import normalization changes and included all currently modified workspace files/artifacts in this commit scope.
