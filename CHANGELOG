- Refactored GUI New Run and Job Detail lifecycle UX with explicit source-mode selection, inline validation, action-first layout, and lifecycle timeline.
- Added stable UI test hooks and expanded lifecycle e2e assertions for source-mode clarity, validation, next-action guidance, and timeline presence.
- Introduced tokenized and reusable UI style primitives with focus-visible accessibility and responsive hardening while preserving existing shared panel/status/table patterns.
- Updated user/runtime/quickstart docs to describe the new UX behavior and runtime hygiene expectations.
- Added `.ui-home/` git ignore coverage and untracked `.ui-home/app.db` from the repository index.
- Updated installation validation runtime home defaults to avoid repo-tracked UI runtime state when `DATA_EXTRACT_UI_HOME` is unset.
- Verified Python-side gates and contract tests still pass; UI gate remains environment-blocked due unavailable npm registry and Playwright assets in this workspace.
- Serialized retry lifecycle persistence so queued state/event commit before retry worker enqueue, eliminating retry-path write races in SQLite.
- Removed temporary lifecycle e2e retry mitigations (`ui` test loop + Playwright CLI retries) and added router regression coverage to the refactor tests gate.

- Hardened local UI/API runtime resilience: startup recovery for queued/running jobs, SQLite WAL/busy-timeout tuning, configurable in-process worker concurrency, and richer health/readiness telemetry.
- Added security and deployment safeguards: API-key middleware support, remote host guardrails in `data-extract ui`, and centralized runtime dependency/readiness checks (including spaCy model validation).
- Reduced API/UI lock pressure with jobs/detail pagination plus client-side database-lock retries and adaptive polling behavior.
- Expanded API/runtime test coverage for auth middleware, health payload detail, queue worker behavior, startup job recovery, and jobs pagination.
- Applied repository-wide lint/import normalization changes and included all currently modified workspace files/artifacts in this commit scope.
- Completed strict stabilization pass: fixed CLI/service import-cycle boundaries, force-mode session cleanup, retry UX/behavior regressions, JSON/TXT output edge cases, and script compatibility mismatches.
- Eliminated strict typing blocker by resolving `mypy --strict` errors across CLI/API/semantic/output/service modules (97 -> 0) without relaxing gate settings.
- Re-ran full validation matrix to green: `ruff check src tests scripts`, `./.venv/bin/mypy src/data_extract/ --strict`, `./.venv/bin/pytest -q`, `npm run build --prefix ui`, and `npm run e2e:gui --prefix ui`.
- Completed public-readiness hardening for the repository: normalized package/license metadata, added MIT `LICENSE`, and aligned README licensing text with open-source distribution.
- Removed tracked local-only assistant runtime config (`.claude/settings.local.json`), hardened `.gitignore` for local state (`.codex/`, local `.claude` settings), and sanitized absolute machine paths across project docs and sample artifacts.
- Replaced public-risk fixture strategy by removing tracked third-party framework documents from `tests/fixtures/real_world_files/`, adding local-only corpus guidance, and deleting derived COBIT output artifacts.
- Fixed root cause in `scripts/create_performance_batch.py` by constraining PDF source selection to curated synthetic fixtures, regenerated `tests/performance/batch_100_files` with the same 100-file contract, and updated performance fixture documentation/baselines accordingly.
- Fixed residual pipeline/output regressions: added advanced->legacy empty-chunk fallback, restored deterministic TXT per-chunk 1-indexed filename sequencing, and corrected status JSON rendering for machine parsing.
- Improved quality-metrics runtime stability by making report generation/log formatting conditional, eliminating non-deterministic performance-scaling test failures under full-suite execution.
- Completed final verification loop to green with current tree: `ruff check src tests scripts`, `./.venv/bin/mypy src/data_extract/ --strict`, and `./.venv/bin/pytest -q` (`2728 passed, 264 skipped, 6 xfailed`).
- Added governance evaluation contract models and processing hooks (API form parsing, run-config resolution, job orchestration persistence, and governance policy/evaluator modules) with baseline policy definitions and unit coverage.
- Fixed evaluation fail-on-bad behavior to set both non-zero exit code and failed job status, so API persistence/retry semantics align with governance verdict outcomes.
- Reworked governance policy loading to prefer packaged resources with development fallback paths, eliminating source-tree path assumptions in installed environments.
- Completed regression validation for current workspace state: `PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/ruff check src tests` and `PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/pytest` (`2736 passed, 264 skipped, 6 xfailed`).
